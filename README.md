# Windows Application using MFC Framework

## Summary
The project was successfully completed, resulting in a Windows application using the MFC framework to manage a row of graphic elements. The application features include initializing the window with 4 graphic elements, each with a value (1 to 4) and other properties, and drawing all elements in the window in a row with ascending order.

## Features Implemented
- Initialized the window with 4 graphic elements, each with a value (1 to 4) and other properties.
- Drew all elements in the window in a row with ascending order.
- Allowed the user to insert elements into the row:
  - Inserted to the beginning: new element's value = original first element's value - 1
  - Inserted to the end: new element's value = original last element's value + 1
  - Inserted to the middle: new element's value = average of the neighboring element's value
- Allowed the user to delete elements from the row, while all others remained the same.
- Auto-aligned the row with equal space between each element.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrated the ability to create a functional Windows application using the MFC framework for managing graphic elements in a row. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing and visualizing the elements in the row, meeting the project requirements and objectives.
